**Changelog for WWW page builder project**

# v 0.0.1 (date)

I was working on DB projecting and reworked the main relation diagram between sites and parts. I also worked on frontend of pageEdit.php and partMenuSelector.php

# v 0.0.0 (date)

Something is working something not. For explenation this project is project for VOŠ a SPŠ, Jičín and owner is me Šimon Cermna. I am planing automatic building and installing app for just uploading to disk and installing by user in GUI. It will allows user to just edit values, turn on/off parts. Maybe i will create multiple styles and allow custom css, custom parts or part editor GUI. This app is still in testing only (most of commits are just Work in progress)
